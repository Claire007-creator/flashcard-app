## 🖥 Understanding Cursor

**What is Cursor?**
Cursor is like Microsoft Word, but for writing code instead of documents. It has special features that help you build apps more easily.

### Key Features:
1. **File Explorer** (left side): Shows all your project files
2. **Code Editor** (center): Where you write your code
3. **Terminal** (bottom): Where you run commands
4. **AI Assistant** (built-in): Helps you write code

## 📁 Understanding Your Project Structure

```
FlashCard-App/
├── public/          # Static files (icons, images)
├── src/             # Your app's code
│   ├── components/  # Reusable pieces (like FlashCard)
│   ├── App.tsx      # Main app file
│   └── App.css      # Main styling
├── README.md        # Project documentation
├── RULES.md         # Development guidelines
└── package.json     # Project settings
```

**Think of it like a house:**
- `public/` = The front door and external features
- `src/` = The interior rooms where you live
- `components/` = Individual rooms (kitchen, bedroom, etc.)
- `App.tsx` = The main living room where everything comes together

- **Cursor saves automatically** when you switch files

### 3. Using the Terminal
- **View → Terminal** to open the terminal
- **Common commands you'll use:**
  ```bash
  npm start          # Start your app
  npm install        # Install new tools
  npm run build      # Prepare app for publishing
  ```

### 4. Using AI Assistant
- **Ctrl+K** (Windows) or **Cmd+K** (Mac): Ask AI to help with code

## 🎨 How to Customize Your Flashcards

### Step 1: Change the Sample Cards
1. **Open `src/App.tsx`**
2. **Find the `sampleCards` section** (around line 6)
3. **Replace with your own words:**

```typescript
const sampleCards = [
  {
    id: 1,
    front: "Apple",
    back: "A round fruit that grows on trees"
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    front: "Friendship",
    back: "A close relationship between two people"
  }
];
```

### Step 2: Change Colors
1. **Open `src/components/FlashCard.css`**
2. **Find the color sections** (around line 20)
3. **Change the colors:**

```css
.flashcard-front {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #ff6b6b 0%, #4ecdc4 100%);
  /* This makes the front red to teal */
}

.flashcard-back {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #a8e6cf 0%, #dcedc1 100%);
  /* This makes the back light green */
}
```

### Step 3: Change Fonts
1. **In the same file**, find `.flashcard-content p`
2. **Add font styles:**

```css
.flashcard-content p {
  margin: 0;
  font-size: 1.1em;
  line-height: 1.4;
  font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', cursive; /* Fun font */
  font-weight: bold; /* Make text bold */
}
```

## 💡 Pro Tips for Using Cursor

### 1. Use AI Assistant Effectively
**Good questions to ask:**
- "How do I center this div?"
- "Add a button that creates a new flashcard"
- "Make this text bigger and bold"
- "How do I add a background image?"

**Bad questions:**
- "Fix my code" (too vague)
- "Make it better" (not specific)

### 2. Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Ctrl+Z** / **Cmd+Z**: Undo changes
- **Ctrl+F** / **Cmd+F**: Find text in current file
- **Ctrl+Shift+F** / **Cmd+Shift+F**: Find text in all files
- **Ctrl+/** / **Cmd+/**: Comment/uncomment lines

### 3. File Management
- **Right-click** in file explorer to create new files/folders
- **Drag files** to move them to different folders
- **Use meaningful names** for your files

### 4. Testing Your App
- **Test on different screen sizes** (resize browser window)
- **Test on mobile** (use browser developer tools)
- **Test with different data** (try long words, short words, etc.)
